# Privacy Compliance

Unity Cloud Build uses your unity id and project id to build your project. It also collects information about the build process and the build logs. The Cloud Build package will collect information about installed Android SDK, XCode version, Unity version, source control changesets, and the build profile. This information is used to provide the build service.

The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in may be updated from time to time in order to assist in your compliance with new data protection regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. Information about such updates, if any, will be provided in the [Unity GDPR and Data Privacy â€“ FAQ](https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy).
